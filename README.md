## URL shortener
This is my first experience of work with GUI (graphical user interface). I made a simple utility using https://bitly.com/ API, that converts long URL to short simple and beatuful URL. 
At the same time I've tried to start work with virtual environment.

main.py - the main script, that launches the graphical interface, where you can paste long URL and convert it to short URL.
requirements.txt - a list of libraries, I've used. You can install all this libraries by the command: python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
env.txt - a file, where I (and you) keep my token from https://bitly.com/. You should register on this site, get your personal access token, then write it in env.txt and rename this file to .env .
